# MZPack
Excel utility pack

The *MZPack for Excel* is a collection of tools and functions specifically developed for Microsoft Excel on Microsoft Windows. These tools were designed to streamline my daily work and simplify the execution of common tasks in Excel, resulting in significant time savings and increased efficiency.

## What is the MZPack add-in?

The MZ Excel Utility Pack is a set of tools and functions specifically designed for Microsoft Excel on Microsoft Windows. These tools aim to save time in my daily work and simplify the execution of common tasks in Excel, making them easier to perform.

The main idea behind the creation of this tool was to ensure simplicity and speed. I intentionally avoided unnecessary features like complex windows, charming wizards, or animated characters. My focus was on functionality and simplicity. All you need to do is click, and things will happen seamlessly.

Even though I initially developed this utility for my personal use, I have decided to publish it under the liberal GNU General Public License (GPL) version 3. This means that you are free to use and distribute it without any charges. If you come across any bugs or have ideas to enhance the utility further, please feel free to reach out to me using the LinkedIn link provided in the footer of this page.

## Do I need the add-in?

If you're uncertain about installing the MZPack, consider answering the following questions:

1. Are you tired of repeatedly performing the same operations in Excel?
2. Do you believe that some of these tasks can be automated, but you're unsure how to do it?
3. Do you often work with reports created by non-professionals, where the data you need to filter is marked with different colors?
4. Would you like to have a say in shaping the future appearance of the tools you use?

If you answered "yes" to at least one of these questions, then the add-in is truly suitable for you. The installation process is straightforwardâ€”simply download the file and start using it. If you ever wish to remove it from your computer, you can do so without leaving any remnants of the software on your disk.

## Requirements

To install and utilize the add-in, all you need is Microsoft Excel 2007 or a later version for Microsoft Windows. The current version of the add-in has been developed and tested for both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows systems. It has been specifically tested on Excel versions 2007, 2010, and 2013.

Please note that the add-in is not compatible with Excel 2003 or earlier versions.

Furthermore, it's important to mention that the add-in has not been tested on Mac OS X, and its functionality on that operating system is uncertain.

## Installation & De-installation

Assuming you have already downloaded the archive file of the MZPack add-in from this site, you can proceed with unpacking it using any ZIP program, such as 7z. Inside the archive, you will find the add-in file in *.xlam format. You have the flexibility to save these files anywhere on your hard disk, but it's important to remember the path to that folder as you will need it for the proper installation of the add-in.

The installation process for this add-in is straightforward and similar to other Excel add-ins. Follow these steps:

1. Click the Microsoft Office Button, and then select Excel Options.

   - In the Add-Ins available box, select the checkbox next to the add-in you want to load, and then click OK.
   - If the desired add-in is not listed in the Add-Ins available box, click Browse and locate the add-in file (recall the folder where you saved the unzipped files).

To unload and uninstall the MZPack add-in, follow these steps:

1. In the Add-Ins available box, clear the checkbox next to the add-in, and then click OK.
2. Restart Excel to remove the add-in from the Office Fluent Ribbon.
